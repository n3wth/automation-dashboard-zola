[@sentry/nextjs] Automatically enabling browser source map generation for turbopack build.
[@sentry/nextjs] Source maps will be automatically deleted after being uploaded to Sentry. If you want to keep the source maps, set the `sourcemaps.deleteSourcemapsAfterUpload` option to false in `withSentryConfig()`. If you do not want to generate and upload sourcemaps at all, set the `sourcemaps.disable` option to true.
 âš  Invalid next.config.ts options detected: 
 âš      Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'nodeMiddleware' at "experimental"
 âš  See more info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/invalid-next-config
 âš  Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of /Users/oliver/package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.
